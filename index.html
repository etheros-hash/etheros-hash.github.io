<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>  This Privacy Policy explains how the PromptGit Chrome Extension (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;the Extension&quot;) collects, uses, and protects any
  information when you use our Extension. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected.</p>
<h2 id="information-we-collect">Information We Collect</h2>
<p>  The PromptGit Chrome Extension collects only the following information:</p>

through the auto-save feature if enabled.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>User preferences</strong>: Your settings within the Extension, such as auto-save preferences and local storage options.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-use-the-information">How We Use The Information</h2>
<p>All information collected by the Extension is stored locally on your device using Chrome&#39;s storage.local API. The Extension is designed
primarily for local use, and by default does not transmit your data to external servers.</p>
<p>Your saved prompts and responses are used solely for the purpose of allowing you to view, manage, and reuse them within supported AI
platforms.</p>
<h2 id="data-storage-and-security">Data Storage and Security</h2>
</li>
<li><p>All data is stored locally on your device.</p>
</li>
<li>No data is transmitted to external servers by default.</li>
<li><p>Data security is maintained through Chrome&#39;s built-in security measures for extensions.</p>
<h2 id="third-party-access">Third-Party Access</h2>
<p>The Extension does not share your data with any third parties. All saved content remains on your local device unless you explicitly
choose to enable synchronization features in future versions.</p>
<h2 id="your-choices">Your Choices</h2>
<p>You maintain full control over your data:</p>
</li>

sharing will be made opt-in, requiring your explicit consent.</p>
