# PromptGit Chrome Extension Privacy Policy

  **Last Updated: March 6, 2024**

  ## Introduction

  This Privacy Policy explains how the PromptGit Chrome Extension ("we", "our", or "the Extension") collects, uses, and protects any
  information when you use our Extension. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected.

  ## Information We Collect

  The PromptGit Chrome Extension collects only the following information:

  1. **User-initiated content**: AI prompts and responses that you explicitly choose to save by clicking the "Save Prompt" button or
  through the auto-save feature if enabled.

  2. **User preferences**: Your settings within the Extension, such as auto-save preferences and local storage options.

  ## How We Use The Information

  All information collected by the Extension is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage.local API. The Extension is designed
  primarily for local use, and by default does not transmit your data to external servers.

  Your saved prompts and responses are used solely for the purpose of allowing you to view, manage, and reuse them within supported AI
  platforms.

  ## Data Storage and Security

  - All data is stored locally on your device.
  - No data is transmitted to external servers by default.
  - Data security is maintained through Chrome's built-in security measures for extensions.

  ## Third-Party Access

  The Extension does not share your data with any third parties. All saved content remains on your local device unless you explicitly
  choose to enable synchronization features in future versions.

  ## Your Choices

  You maintain full control over your data:
  - You decide which prompts and responses to save.
  - You can view your saved items through the Extension popup.
  - You can delete saved items at any time.
  - You can adjust settings to control how the Extension functions.

  ## Future Features

  If future versions of the Extension include optional cloud synchronization features, this privacy policy will be updated, and any data
  sharing will be made opt-in, requiring your explicit consent.

  ## Changes to This Privacy Policy

  We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and
   updating the Extension. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
